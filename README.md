Tiny templates for HTML preprocessing.

Work-in-progress.

## What is this?

This is a small C++ library to add templates to HTML and pre-process them.

## What will this do

- Conditional html
- Substituting text in html
- For loops in html

### Future plans

- Inline conditions
- Including other files
- Better error handling than nuking the rendering

## What this will not do

- Advanced templates
- Functions
- Other languages
